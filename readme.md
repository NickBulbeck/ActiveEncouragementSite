# This is based on Brad Schiff's Udemy Course, his example site being for a fictitious
# travel agency. I've updated it to be a directly relevant out-reach to those
# struggling to find employment and, perhaps, needing just a bit of encouragement and 
# love, and a message of hope. It's also a learning/kata exercise for me.

# The name SkeletonNodeSite is to distinguish it from more specific and personalised
# sites I'll create alongside it.

# At the time of last commit, the structure of the repo and the purpose of the site are in
# a state of flux, as I'm still to decide on the best way of working. But I think I'm
# close to a settled approach.
