# This is based on Brad Schiff's Udemy Course, his example site being for a fictitious
# travel agency. I've updated it to be a directly relevant out-reach to those
# struggling to find employment and, perhaps, needing just a bit of encouragement and 
# love, and a message of hope.

# The name ActiveEncouragementSite is to distinguish it from the quick and cheerful
# WordPress blog I'm going to create with just a single static page and some kind of
# analytics (if I can). "Active" means that the site on this repo will have javascript-
# driven behaviour, and can potentially send people different messages in different
# circumstances.

# At the time of writing, I have literally no idea whether either of them will achieve
# anything, help anyone, or even be read by anyone. But something is worth a try.
