# This is based on Brad Schiff's Udemy Course, his example site being for a fictitious
# travel agency. I've updated it to be a directly relevant out-reach to those
# struggling to find employment and, perhaps, needing just a bit of encouragement and 
# love, and a message of hope. It's also a learning/kata exercise for me.

# The name SkeletonNodeSite is to distinguish it from more specific and personalised
# sites I'll create alongside it.

# At the time of last commit, the structure of the repo and the purpose of the site are in
# a state of flux, as I'm still to decide on the best way of working. But I think I'm
# close to a settled approach.

# The name ActiveEncouragementSite is to distinguish it from a quick and cheerful
# WordPress blog I could create with just a single static page and some kind of
# analytics widget. "Active" means that the site on this repo will have javascript-
# driven behaviour, and can potentially send people different messages in different
# circumstances.
#
# At the time of writing, I have literally no idea whether either of them will achieve
# anything, help anyone, or even be read by anyone. But something is worth a try.
